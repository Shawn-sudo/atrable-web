            <dl>
              We collect your personal information! (quite scary huh). It
              includes
            </dl>
            <ul>
              <li>your name</li>
              <li>your username</li>
              <li>your email</li>
              <li>
                your password (hashed with salt) (not joking, that's how you
                properly protect the original passwords from bad hackers)
              </li>
              <li>
                your voice, if you share a post or send a voice message that
                contains your voice
              </li>
              <li>
                your face, if you set profile photo, share a post, or send a
                message that contains your face
              </li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
              Your name and username are saved when you set up your profile.
              Depending on the situation, changing your profile photo may also
              save your face if it includes your face. The profile created can
              be accessed by anyone using Atrable.
            </dl>
            <dl>
              Your email and password are collected when you create an account.
              If you use Social login (like pressing "Continue with Apple"
              thingy), password wouldn't be collected. Email would be used to
              identify your account and to notify you when there's an update on
              policies. Password would be used to protect your account from
              others. Don't reuse passwords.
            </dl>
            <dl>
              Your voice and face are collected when you share a post or send a
              message that contians those.

            <dl>
              "Atrable" is a random app name Seihyun Lee came up with to make an
              website. He wanted to have a .com domain, and "Atrable" was the
              only name he came up with which .com domain hasn't been taken. The
              company "Atrable" is not registered yet, but it would be
              registered as soon as possible if many people starts using Atrable
              app.
