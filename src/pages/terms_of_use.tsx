          <ol>
            <li style={{ fontWeight: "bold" }}>Privacy</li>
            <dl>We collect your personal information. It includes</dl>
            <ul>
              <li>your name</li>
              <li>your username</li>
              <li>your email</li>
              <li>
                your password (hashed with salt) (that's how you properly
                protect the original passwords from bad hackers)
              </li>
              <li>
                your voice, if you share a post or send a voice message that
                contains your voice
              </li>
              <li>
                your face, if you set profile photo, share a post, or send a
                message that contains your face
              </li>
            </ul>
            <dl>
              If you share these personal data with us, we would save those on
              our server, but we don't analyze it. We aren't really interested
              in you.
            </dl>
            <dl>
              <strong>Profile: </strong>
              Your name and username are saved when you set up your profile. If
              your profile photo contains your face, your face would be saved on
              our server. Profiles can be accessed by anyone using Atrable.
            </dl>
            <dl>
              <strong>Authentication: </strong>
              Your email and password are collected when you create an account.
              If you use Social login (like pressing "Continue with Apple"
              thingy), password wouldn't be collected. Email is used to identify
              your account and to notify you when there's an update on policies.
              Password is used to protect your account from others. Don't reuse
              passwords.
            </dl>
            <dl>
              <strong>Post and Chat: </strong>
              Your voice and face are saved in our server when you share a post
              or send a message that contains those.

            <dl>
              "Atrable" is a random app name Seihyun Lee came up with to make an
              website. He wanted to have a .com domain, and "Atrable" was the
              only name he came up with which .com domain hasn't been taken. The
              company "Atrable" is not registered yet, but it would be
              registered as soon as possible if people start using Atrable.

              terms with you. If you're a parent or legal guardian, and if you
              allow your child to use Atrable, these terms apply to you and
              you're responsible for your child's activity on Atrable.
