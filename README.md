## Migrating to NextJS soon
We needed SSR for /u/** pages, but GatsbyJS doesn't really support SSR well (they have some documentations, but it wasn't sufficient enough to actually make one)

## Used to be the source code for www.atrable.com

## Routes
- / : Welcome page with some of my video diaries
- /u/** : Display the profile

## Technology
[GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) and [Firebase Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/products/hosting/) (They are all free yay)
